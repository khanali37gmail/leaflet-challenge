# Belly Butoon Analysis


## Project Overview

This project involves building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which contains information about microbial species found in human navels.

## Data Visualization:

Use the D3 library to read the samples.json file from a provided URL.
Create a horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 microbial species (OTUs) found in an individual's navel.
Use sample_values as bar chart values, otu_ids as labels, and otu_labels as hovertext.
Create a bubble chart displaying each sample, with otu_ids as x values, sample_values as y values, and otu_labels as text values.

## Display Metadata:

Update all plots when a new sample is selected from a dropdown menu.
Create any layout for your dashboard according to your preference.
